# routeMapsGenerator.js

Generates driver instruction maps and mapbox-gl style files with embedded route data using the map generator from the included JORE data dumps in the data folder.

## Running

`node -r babel-register scripts/routeMapsGenerator.js`

TODO: you must change the hsl-map-generator-utils to point to the file `hsl-gl-map-with-stops-v9-route-map.json` in `hsl-map-style`
